   Yocto Project
      The |Yocto long| is a Linux Foundation workgroup whose goal is to produce
      tools and processes that will enable the creation of Linux distributions
      for embedded software that are independent of the underlying architecture
      of the embedded software itself. The project was announced by the Linux
      Foundation in 2010. In March 2011, the project aligned itself with
      |OE|, an existing framework with similar goals, with the result being The
      |OE long|-Core Project.

      The |Yocto long| is an open source project whose focus is on improving
      the software development process for embedded Linux distributions. The
      |Yocto long| provides interoperable tools, metadata, and processes that
      enable the rapid, repeatable development of Linux-based embedded systems.

   OpenEmbedded
      |OE long| is a software framework used for creating Linux distributions
      aimed for, but not restricted to, embedded devices. The build system is
      based on |BB| recipes.

   BitBake
      |BB long| is a make-like build tool with the special focus of
      distributions and packages for embedded Linux cross compilation although
      it is not limited to that. It is derived from Portage, which is the
      package management system used by the Gentoo Linux distribution.
      |BB long| existed for some time in the |OE long| project until it was
      separated out into a standalone, maintained, distribution-independent
      tool. |BB long| is co-maintained by the |Yocto long| and the
      |OE long| project.

   API
      In computer programming, an |API long| (API) is a set of routines,
      protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses
      a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and
      underlying types. An API defines functionalities that are independent of
      their respective implementations, which allows definitions and
      implementations to vary without compromising each other. A good API makes
      it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.
      A programmer then puts the blocks together.

   CLI
      A |CLI long| (CLI), also known as command-line user interface,
      console user interface, and character user interface (CUI),
      is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user
      (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive
      lines of text (command lines).

   UI
      The |UI long|, in the industrial design field of human–machine
      interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and
      machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective
      operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst
      the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the
      operators decision making process.

   GUI
      In computing, a |GUI long| (GUI, sometimes pronounced "gooey"
      or "gee-you-eye") is a type of interface that allows users to interact
      with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators
      such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed
      command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction
      to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces
      (|CLI|\ s), which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.

   SouP
      SouP stands for software of unknown (or uncertain) provenance.
      It is a term often used in the context of safety-critical
      and safety-involved systems such as medical software. SouP is software
      that has not been developed with a known software development process or
      methodology, or which has unknown or no safety-related properties.

   ARM
      Is a family of instruction set architectures for computer processors
      based on a reduced instruction set computing (|RISC|) architecture
      developed by British company ARM Holdings. ARM is a abbreviation of
      Acorn RISC Machines, later called |ARM long|.

   RISC
      A |RISC long| is a |CPU| design strategy based on the insight that
      simplified instruction set (as opposed to a complex set) provides higher
      performance when combined with a microprocessor architecture capable of
      executing those instructions using fewer microprocessor cycles per
      instruction. A computer based on this strategy is a reduced instruction
      set computer, also called RISC.

   CPU
      A |CPU long| (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that
      carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the
      basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations
      specified by the instructions. The term has been used in the computer
      industry at least since the early 1960s.

   GPU
      A |CPU long| (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to
      rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images
      in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. GPUs are used in
      embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and
      game consoles. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating computer
      graphics and image processing, and their highly parallel structure makes
      them more effective than general-purpose |CPU|\ s for algorithms where
      processing of large blocks of data is done in parallel.

   RAM
      A |RAM long| (RAM) is a form of computer data storage. A |RAM long|
      device allows data items to be read and written in roughly the same
      amount of time regardless of the order in which data items are accessed.
      RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory, where stored
      information is lost if power is removed.

   SoC
      A |SoC long| (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit (IC) that integrates
      all components of a computer or other electronic system into a single
      chip. It may contain digital, analog, mixed-signal, and often
      radio-frequency functions—all on a single chip substrate. SoCs are very
      common in the mobile electronics market because of their low power
      consumption. A typical application is in the area of embedded systems.

   USB
      The |USB long| (USB) is an industry standard developed in the mid-1990s
      that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in
      a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers
      and electronic devices.
